## Description: ##
There's more to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y7AxYvBwJ1DeapnhV401w0T5HzQNIfrN1WeQFbnwbIE/edit) than meets the eye.

## Solution: ##
The description hints at a hidden sheet, and after poking around, I found that using "Find and replace" searches through all sheets. So I searched for "flag" and it went to the cell in the hidden sheet with the flag.

## Flag: ##
flag{hidden_sheets_are_not_actually_hidden}
