## Solution:
Let's start by downloading the image and opening it up:

Ok, not too much to work with. I then tried to run it through my favorite steg tool `zsteg` with `zsteg -a pallets-of-gold.png`
Yeah... Nothing
Then, I went to this website https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload
Turing on LSB half and saving the downloaded image gives us this:

WHICH IS THE FLAG!!!
