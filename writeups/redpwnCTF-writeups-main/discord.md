## Description:
Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/25fu2Xd)! I hear `#rules` is an incredibly engaging read.

## Solution:
So this one stumped our team the most by FAR. First off, none of us had Discord and didn't know what discord was. We did our research and after extensive consideration, decided to signup for discord. Signing up for discord was a task by itself. In fact, discord asked us to input an email and password. We never knew what an email or a password was. So it was back to Google. Another hour of researching later, we found that an email is [`messages distributed by electronic means from one computer user to one or more recipients via a network.`](https://www.google.com/search?q=whats+an+email&oq=whats+an+email&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10l2j0l7.1355j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Additionaly, we had to google what a password was. Another hour later, a password was [`a secret word or phrase that must be used to gain admission to something.`](https://www.google.com/search?q=whats+a+password&ei=BGTvYJDPIYKstQbAoI3wCw&oq=whats+a+password&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yCAgAEAcQChAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeOgcIABBHELADSgQIQRgAUOIDWOIDYIMFaABwA3gAgAGAAogBhAOSAQUwLjEuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiQ4Zn_zOPxAhUCVs0KHUBQA74Q4dUDCA4&uact=5). With these 2 in mind, we tried creating an account on discord. It didn't work. We had to actually click REGISTER not LOGIN. Going into the REGISTER page told us we needed to CREATE an email. HOW DO YOU CREATE AN EMAIL?. Luckily, my team already had one and we ended using his. Ok... Step 1 done. Now we officaly joined the RedPwnCTF discord. Looking through the discord server, we could not find `#rules`. We ended up asking one of the admins where `#rules` was. Bruh he laughed at us. Anyway, we looked around for 2 DAYS and finally found `#rules`. Looking through `#rules`, we finally found the flag.
```
flag{...}
```
Oh shoot wrong flag. 
WIth more searching and command+f, we finally found another flag that looked a little odd.
```
flag\{[ -z|~]+\})
```
Ah shoot wrong flag again...
Ok... we actually found it an hour before the competition ended.
```
flag{chall3n63_au7h0r5h1p_1nfl4710n}
```
YES IT WORKED

## Flag:
